Draw trees using Godot and rust. ðŸŒ³ðŸ¤–ðŸ¦€

## PNG Generation

This project implements procedural drawing of trees in [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/) using [Lindenmayer Systems](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/#abop).

The trees are written to disk as PNGs and can't be dynamically generated during the course of gameplay. However, they can be packaged as assets once generated. We hope to add the ability to generate Godot `Image`s dynamically during the course of a game session. See issues [21](https://github.com/Terkwood/forest/issues/21) and [23](https://github.com/Terkwood/forest/issues/23). 

### Justification

We found that [Godot custom drawing in 2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.2/tutorials/2d/custom_drawing_in_2d.html) slows the frame rate when compared to using sprites with pre-drawn textures.

## Building the dependencies

You need to build the `gen` dependency so that Godot has access to the shared lib written in rust:

```sh
cd gen
cargo build --release
```
